			This is so humiliating: 
			I know I’m healthy 
			When I’m night driving to meet my needs 
			And there's Bloodcomb Jellyfish DNA 
			Crispred into my DNA bioluminescence hijacking 
			The scene I’m exchanging body for a witness. 
			Haha
			Made out of celery or algae or neon
			At this point.
			Thud the tank, send me a hyperlink 
			Blue AI generated narration of my body 
			She's in the “the ocean” now, the shower,  
			Using a Dove bar soap, generating “innocent”
			It’s cucumber scented. My orchid and my curtain 
			Are touching, “holding hands”. Computers and people 
			Will just invent anything. Inventing naturals things
			Like a kiss through the screen, 
			9088099307, if you ever thought 
			About buying a glow in the dark fish: 
			Don't be shy, everyone is naturally in love with me:
			Plugging a lime into the wall 
			To light the scene 
			Where I’m luhboratory examining 
			If phytoplankton react to 
			Me telling them they’re healthy 
			Their bodies are humiliating little machines 
			It's so funny. Natural in pigtails when I’m lying
			When I’m fat and when I’m swimming
			Natural in Katherine’s poem 
			As a “jumbo shrimp”, “infinitely winning”
			Don’t waste your time freezing my corpse 
			I’ll be alive the whole time.
