            This is so humiliating: I know I’m healthy When I’m night driving to meet my needs And there's Bloodcomb Jellyfish DNA Crispred into my DNA bioluminescence hijacking The scene I’m exchanging body for a witness. Haha Made out of celery or algae or neon
            At this point. Thud the tank, send me a hyperlink Blue AI generated narration of my body She's in the “the ocean” now, the shower, Using a Dove bar soap, generating “innocent” It’s cucumber scented. My orchid and my curtain Are touching, “holding
            hands”. Computers and people Will just invent anything. Inventing naturals things Like a kiss through the screen, 9088099307, if you ever thought About buying a glow in the dark fish: Don't be shy, everyone is naturally in love with me: Plugging
            a lime into the wall To light the scene Where I’m luhboratory examining If phytoplankton react to Me telling them they’re healthy Their bodies are humiliating little machines It's so funny. Natural in pigtails when I’m lying When I’m fat and
            when I’m swimming Natural in Katherine’s poem As a “jumbo shrimp”, “infinitely winning” Don’t waste your time freezing my corpse I’ll be alive the whole time.
